### My story

Hi! My name is Hudson Lin. I am interested in learning more about basic tech even though I lack strong foundational coding skills which is why I chose to enroll in this class. I think that technology drives innovation and the future so being somewhat literate in this area is important. I hope that I can walk away from this class having learned some valuable skills (I already have by making this website on Github!)
