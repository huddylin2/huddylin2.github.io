- Use an integer variable, runTimes to determine how many times the loop runs.
- Every 10th time through the loop, the program prints a color, either RED, GREEN, or BLUE.
- Each color is printed three times, but only on the 10th time through the loop (i.e., 0, 10, 20, 30, ...)
- runTimes can be any integer!

## tip
Reduce redundancy by using less than, greater than, or equal to statements
