- Doing the plushy labubu took some time, and going through the instructions. I could have done a better job, but it was an overall good experience. My circuit was working with alligator clips, but the connection stays on with the connective thread. I wonder if it's because I didn't sew through the connections multiple times.

I wasn't able to take a picture, but took the circuit from 4 in the problem set and applied it to my plushy, and I can verify by word that it worked (your choice to take my word for it)
