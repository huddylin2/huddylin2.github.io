## Title
The title of my project is "Hudson's Deconstructed Headlight"

## Description
I have an on/off switch and a light sensor. When the switch is on and the light sensor detects a darkness threshold, an RGB LED starts to fade up in red for 1 second. While this is happening, there are two red leds that blink sequentially over the course of a second (O.5 seconds for each light). Then, the RGB LED will fade up in blue for 1 second. While this is happening, there are two blue leds that blink sequentially over the course of a second (O.5 seconds for each light). After this, the RGB LED will fade up in green for 1 second. While this is happening, both the red and blue leds will blink sequentially over the course of a second (O.5 seconds for each light). This is what was supposed to happen. Unfortunately, my project did no work during demonstration.

## Motivation
Since I was a little boy, I have always loved cars. I was obsessed with the fast and furious movies. Tokyo Drift was my favorite. I also enjoy understanding how things work. I would say that this project satisfied my desire to learn how things work. By doing this project, I learned the internal workings of how a simple component like a turn signal is incredibly complex. Even after doing a paper protoype, I did not realiz how hard the circuity would be. 

## Comprehensive Materials List
1 Lilypad Arduino
2 red LEDS
2 blue LEDS
1 RGB LED
1 switch
1 light sensor
3 patches of fabric
Conductive thread

## 3 Tips to my Past Self
1. Give yourself more fabric to sew with because circuit will be quite large because I will have to "circle" around the arduino to connect all my components
