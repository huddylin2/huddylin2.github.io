## Title
The title of my project is "Hudson's Deconstructed Headlight"

## Description
I have an on/off switch and a light sensor. When the switch is on and the light sensor detects a darkness threshold, an RGB LED starts to fade up in red for 1 second. While this is happening, there are two red leds that blink sequentially over the course of a second (O.5 seconds for each light). Then, the RGB LED will fade up in blue for 1 second. While this is happening, there are two blue leds that blink sequentially over the course of a second (O.5 seconds for each light). After this, the RGB LED will fade up in green for 1 second. While this is happening, both the red and blue leds will blink sequentially over the course of a second (O.5 seconds for each light). This is what was supposed to happen. Unfortunately, my project did no work during demonstration.

## Motivation
Since I was a little boy, I have always loved cars. I was obsessed with the fast and furious movies. Tokyo Drift was my favorite. I also enjoy understanding how things work. I would say that this project satisfied my desire to learn how things work. By doing this project, I learned the internal workings of how a simple component like a turn signal is incredibly complex. Even after doing a paper protoype, I did not realiz how hard the circuity would be. 

## Comprehensive Materials List
1 Lilypad Arduino
2 red LEDS
2 blue LEDS
1 RGB LED
1 switch
1 light sensor
3 patches of fabric
Conductive thread

## Revised Paper Prototype

## Alligator Prototype
My prototype used 10 connections and would require 17 alligator clips, so I was unable to make an alligator prototype. In retrospect, I should have asked Professor Howley for more alligator clips to create an alligator prototype

## Final Circuit Front and Back
While I could not get my final circuit to work, I have attatched photos of the front and back of my circuit

## 3 Tips to my Past Self
1. Give yourself more fabric to sew with because circuit will be quite large because I will have to "circle" around the arduino to connect all my components
2. Think about how many ports you will be using for your project. If you have too many componenets operating individually, then the arduino will not have the capacity
3. Use a thicker singular piece of fabric to ensure traces don't cross causing short-circuits

## Citations of Resources Used
For this project, I used class materials from code examples and lectures on the course glow page.
