- The program's output must depend on the value set in the temperature variable.
- You must use at least an if statement, an else if statement, and an else statement that all print something different.
- Each of your if / else if / else statements should be reachable, simply by changing the value of the temperature variable.
- Appropriate use of the && and || operators.
- Consider the following possible values for temperature: -50, 0, 32, 70, 100, 2000 (but note that your code should respond appropriately for any integer value).
