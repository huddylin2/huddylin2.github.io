Read this blog post to learn more about my **name, year, major, sewing, programming, learning hopes, and boring fact about me**

## Lets Go

Hi my name is **Hudson or Huddy** and I am a junior in the class of **2027**. I am a **political science major**. I have **very limited** sewing experience so I am basically starting as a beginner. I have taken coding classes in the past but I always struggled a lot understanding coding so I would say that my coding experience is **very limited** if any. A learning hope that I have is to learn some **basic tech skills** because I think that understanding technology will be the future of industry. A boring fact about me that is actually not that boring is that **I LOVE MARSHAWN LYNCH**. That's why he's my profile page icon. On the field, he is one of the most dominant running backs in NFL history in my humble opinion. You can watch some of his highlights [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXOZdMeSIEo). There is a reason Marshawn is called _beast mode_. Off the field he is one of the funniest guys to do it. Watch his funniest moments [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzY-NUxiSpI). One last point on my soapbox. Following his retirement from the NFL, he can be seen taking pictures on the field:
