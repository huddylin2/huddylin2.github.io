{: .box-success}
- The program's output must depend on the value set in led1, led2, led3, which depend on the values set in btn (button) and swt (switch). You must check each of the values stored in btn and swt to determine what values to change the LEDs to.
- Depending on the values of btn and swt, integer variables, led1, led2, and led3 will change. If the button and switch are both 'on', then all the LED values should be set to the value representing on..
- You must check each of the values stored in led1, led2, led3 to determine what to print. If one is on & 2 off, then ‘ON’, 'OFF', 'OFF' should be printed. Text should be displayed, not numbers!
- The LEDs may be represented by ints: generally, when we have only two possible value options (like 'off' and 'on'), we use a boolean variable, or the integers 0 and 1 to represent that.
- In-line comments and proper indentation make code more legible. Avoid repetitive/redundant code!
